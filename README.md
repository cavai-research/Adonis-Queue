# Adonis Queue

> Queue for AdonisJS 5

It provides in-memory and Redis based queues to run jobs

Supports running jobs in queue, setting job execution timestamp and status reporting

It's quite basic currently and doesn't support job timeouts, rate limits, parallel or batch processing etc

## Installation

- Run `npm install @cavai/adonis-queue` to install it
- Run `node ace invoke @cavai/adonis-queue` to generate configuration files

## Configuration

Queue configuration file is in `config/queue.ts`

### Memory queue (default)

Memory queue is the most basic queue. It runs jobs async in the background and is recommended for testing and developing or for some really basic use-cases

It doesn't require any additional setup, but having some heavy running job can stop the whole NodeJS event loop, thus making application unresponsive. Since all memory queues and job state are stored in memory, they will be wiped in case of application restarts / crashes

Default memory queue configuration:

```ts
export default {
  exampleQueue: {
    name: 'exampleQueue',
    driver: 'memory',
    config: {
      pollingDelay: 500,
      activateDelayedJobs: false,
    },
  },
}
```

- **name** is just name of queue. It's nice to have it the same as queue object
- **driver** is the driver to use. In current case it's `memory`
- **config** additional configuration specific for memory queue.
  - `pollingDelay`: a time in milliseconds that determines how quickly the next job is started after finishing the previous one;
  - `activateDelayedJobs`: a setting that enables delayed jobs. If it is disabled and a job with `runAt` property is added, it is never processed.

### Redis queue

Redis queue uses lightweight [BeeQueue](https://github.com/bee-queue/bee-queue) under the hood

Redis version is better for production, since it doesn't have the problems that memory queue has. Data is persisted in Redis and in case of application crashes or restarts it's not lost.

Redis queue job processing is also ran as a separate NodeJS instance, so any job can't block the main application event loop and vice-versa

Downside of this queue is a slightly harder setup, since it requires Redis to be installed, and slightly higher resource consumption. There will be another instance of NodeJS and Redis also running, instead of just single NodeJS instance

Default Redis queue configuration:

```ts
export default {
  exampleQueue: {
    name: 'exampleQueue',
    driver: 'redis',
    config: {
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      port: 6379,
      activateDelayedJobs: false,
    },
  },
}
```

- **name** is just name of queue. It's nice to have it the same as queue object
- **driver** is the driver to use. In current case it's `redis`
- **config** additional configuration specific for redis queue. Config object is passed down to BeeQueue, check [BeeQueue documentation](https://github.com/bee-queue/bee-queue#settings) for all options

## Usage

For different kinds of jobs there will be different kinds of queues. For example for emails you might have `signupEmailQueue`, while for notifications you might have `discordNotificationQueue`. Jobs from different queues can run in parallel (sharing event loop), while jobs in a single queue are executed in order. However, this doesn't hold when there are multiple processes, in that case jobs in a single queue can be finished out of sequence if they have different durations.

### Define job

By default jobs are defined in `start/jobs.ts`

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'
import Mail from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/Mail'

// Defining job in 'signupEmailQueue'
Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').process(async (job) => {
  // Send signup email
  await Mail.send((message) => {
    message
      .from('info@example.com')
      .to(job.payload.email)
      .subject('Welcome Onboard!')
      .htmlView('emails/welcome', { name: job.payload.name })
    })
})
```

### Add job to queue

Adding jobs to queue can be done everywhere in application. Just need to import queue

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'

// Add job to signupEmailQueue
// With payload as our nice fake new user
let job = Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').add({
  email: 'foo@bar.com',
  name: 'FooBar',
})
```

### Timing a job

To add a timed job to the queue add an options object as a second argument containing `runAt` time in milliseconds when the processing of the job should be started.

Note: a timed job will be processed only if the setting `activateDelayedJobs` of the queue is enabled (see [above](#configuration)).

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'

// Add job to signupEmailQueue
// With payload as our nice fake new user
// and with a delay of 300 ms
let job = Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').add({
  email: 'foo@bar.com',
  name: 'FooBar',
}, {
  runAt: Date.now() + 300,
})
```

### Get job by its ID

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'

const job = await Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').getJob(10) // where 10 is job ID
```

### Reporting job progress

Job progress can be reported with `job.reportProgress(any)`

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'
import Mail from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/Mail'

// Defining job in 'signupEmailQueue'
Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').process(async (job) => {
  // Report job progress
  job.reportProgress('Sending mail')

  // Send signup email
  await Mail.send((message) => {
    message
      .from('info@example.com')
      .to(job.payload.email)
      .subject('Welcome Onboard!')
      .htmlView('emails/welcome', { name: job.payload.name })
  })

  // Report job progress
  job.reportProgress('Mail sent')
})
```

### Start the queue

To run queue just run `node ace queue:start`.

> It's not needed when using only memory queue, since in-memory one will share NodeJS instance with main AdonisJS application

> It's possible to run several queue instances if you want to run jobs in all queues in parallel


### Retries

There is no retry support out of box, but you can always wrap your code into `try-catch` block and re-schedule job for processing in `catch` block

```ts
import Queue from '@ioc:Cavai/Adonis-Queue'

// Need to limit how many times job is can be requeued
// Otherwise permanently broken jobs will bog down whole queue
const MAX_RETRIES = 3

Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').process(async (job) => {
  // Wrap job into try-catch block
  try {
    // ... failing code
  } catch (error) {
    // Job failed, log error and re-queue it
    console.error(error)

    // Check if still within retries budget
    let retries = job.payload.retries || 0
    
    if (retries < MAX_RETRIES) {
      // Add job back to queue with incremented retries counter
      Queue.use('signupEmailQueue').add({
        email: 'foo@bar.com',
        name: 'FooBar',
        retries: retries += 1
      }) 
    } else {
      // In case retries have been exhausted throw error
      throw error
    }
  }
})
```
